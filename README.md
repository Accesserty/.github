## ðŸ§­ Brand Positioning
Making information experiences transparent, participatory, and improvable.
Accesserty is a web experience transparency layer for information equity. It enables usersâ€”through their everyday searching and browsingâ€”to clearly see which websites are willing to listen, ready to improve, and actively taking action.

## ðŸŒŸ Vision 
Enable everyone to access information freely, without being excluded by technology, disability, or design.
Accesserty is committed to creating a web space rooted in information equity, where differences in user experience are seen â€” and improved.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission
Build an information ecosystem where website experiences are transparent, improvement mechanisms are visible, and user participation is simple and accessible.
